The package currently support the following further R options, which you can set
either in your R profile file or a script via \code{\link{options}}:

\describe{
  \item{BatchJobs.verbose}{This boolean flag can be set to \code{FALSE} to reduce the
    console output of the package operations. Usually you want to see this output in interactive
    work, but when you  use the package in e.g. knitr documents,
    it clutters the resulting document too much.}
  \item{BatchJobs.check.posix}{If this boolean flag is enabled, the package checks your
    registry file dir (and related user-defined directories) quite strictly to be POSIX compliant.
    Usually this is a good idea, you do not want to have strange chars in your file paths,
    as this might results in problems  when these paths get passed to the scheduler or other
    command-line tools that the package interoperates with.
    But on some OS this check might be too strict and cause problems.
    Setting the flag to \code{FALSE} allows to disable the check entirely.
    The default is \code{FALSE} on Windows systems and \code{TRUE} else.}
