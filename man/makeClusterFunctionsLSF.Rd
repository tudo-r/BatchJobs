\description{
Job files are created based on the brew template
\code{template.file}. This file is processed with brew and then
submitted to the queue using the \code{bsub} command. Jobs are
killed using the \code{bkill} command and the list of running jobs
is retrieved using \code{bjobs -u $USER -w}. The user must have the
appropriate privileges to submit, delete and list jobs on the
cluster (this is usually the case).

The template file can access all arguments passed to the
\code{submitJob} function, see here \code{\link{ClusterFunctions}}.
It is the template file's job to choose a queue for the job
and handle the desired resource allocations.
